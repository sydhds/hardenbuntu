## Hardenbuntu

Hardenbuntu is both a manual and (in the future) a script to harden your ubuntu system.

Goals:
* Harden a ubuntu system for desktop usage (for now)
* Explain & provide reference
* Add information about performance / compatibility issue
* Privacy recommandations are welcome (but not the main goal)

Contributions:
* Any contribution/question/translation is welcome!
* Open an issue in github
* Or fork the repo and create a PR

## Disclaimer

**This is in a very early stage and still WIP !**

## Sections

* [General](general.md)
* [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md)
* [Linux](linux.md)
* [Browser](browser.md)
